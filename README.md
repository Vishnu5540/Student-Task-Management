1️⃣ What is this project about?

Answer:
This project is a console-based Student Task Management System built using Java.
It allows users to add tasks, view tasks, and mark tasks as completed, helping manage daily activities efficiently.

2️⃣ Why did you choose this project?

Answer:
I chose this project to strengthen my understanding of Java fundamentals, object-oriented programming, and collections while building a practical, real-world application.

3️⃣ What Java concepts did you use in this project?

Answer:
I used object-oriented programming concepts such as classes and encapsulation, Java Collections (ArrayList), loops, conditionals, and user input handling using Scanner.

4️⃣ How is data stored in your project?

Answer:
Tasks are stored in an ArrayList, which allows dynamic storage and easy addition, retrieval, and updating of task objects during program execution.

5️⃣ Why did you use ArrayList instead of an array?

Answer:
ArrayList provides dynamic resizing and built-in methods for adding and iterating elements, making it more flexible and easier to manage compared to fixed-size arrays.

6️⃣ Explain the role of each class.

Answer:

Task class represents the task model containing task details.

TaskManager class handles business logic such as adding, viewing, and updating tasks.

Main class acts as the entry point and manages user interaction.

7️⃣ How does your program follow OOP principles?

Answer:
The project follows encapsulation by keeping task data private and accessing it through public methods. Responsibilities are separated across classes to improve readability and maintainability.

8️⃣ How do you mark a task as completed?

Answer:
The program searches for the task using its ID and updates its status field from “Pending” to “Completed” using setter methods.

9️⃣ How do you handle invalid input?

Answer:
Basic validation is handled by checking if the task exists before updating it. If the task ID is not found, the program displays an appropriate message.

🔟 What improvements can be added in the future?

Answer:

File handling to store tasks permanently

Task priority levels

Due dates

GUI using JavaFX or Swing

1️⃣1️⃣ What did you learn from this project?

Answer:
I improved my understanding of Java OOP concepts, collections, and structuring code for real-world applications, along with better problem-solving skills.

1️⃣2️⃣ Is this project scalable?

Answer:
Currently, it is suitable for small-scale use. With enhancements like database integration and layered architecture, it can be scaled further.
